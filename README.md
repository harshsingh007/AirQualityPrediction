AIR QUALITY PREDICTION USING IOT AND CLOUD APPLICATION

In order to monitor the air quality level in the various location in various time interval this device can be used.It is necessary to monitor air quality and keep it under control for a better future and healthy living in large scale.We are going to make an IOT(Internet of Things) based air pollution monitoring system in which we will monitor the Air Quality over a web server using internet and will trigger a alarm when the air quality goes down below a certain level, means when there is sucient amount of harmful dust so that Asthma patient can use this at their home. It will show the air quality in screen and as well as on web-page so that we can monitor it very easily.In this IOT project, you can monitor the pollution level from anywhere using your computer or mobile.
This System is designed,implemented and tested to monitor the pinpoints
